This is my project "alien_invasion" that I have made for my Final Project for my CS 1410 Python class. 
The project is a simple game similar to Galaga. 

To run this game, simply download all the python files and the "images" file into a folder and name it "alien_invasion". Then run the code in the main file: "alien_invasion.py".
This should run the game, and you can exit the game at any time by pressing "q" on the keyboard, or simply hitting the exit button. 

The game runs in levels, and every time you destroy all the alien ships it will advance to the next level. 
Every time you advance to the next level, it will also increase the speed at which the enemy ships are moving. 
You have three lives, as displayed in the top left corner, and any time the enemy ships collide with you, it will cause you to lose a life. 

Thanks for checking it out
