This is my project "alien_invasion" that I have made for my Final Project for my CS 1410 Python class. 
The project is a simple game similar to Galaga. 

To run this game, simply download all the python files and the "images" file into a folder and name it "alien_invasion". Then run the code in the main file: "alien_invasion.py".
This should run the game, and you can exit the game at any time by pressing "q" on the keyboard, or simply hitting the exit button. 

Thanks for checking it out!
